INTERACT WITH CAUTION, MY HUMOUR CAN MAKE SOME PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

 hi im solace/bread im a minor and my interests are msi, cof, forsaken, combat initiation, PLS COMBAT INITIATION FANS WRY.. 💔

BYI
ive noticed i have a social awareness of a potato and that i suck at carrying the convo im sorry if im boring to talk to, im actively trying my best to literally just stay in topic since i jump from one to another without realizing, im really socially awkward at first so mybad if i make the convo dry. sometimes im too shy to approach you. im kind of a sensitive person at heart so if ur like a stranger to me i would take it srsly if u told me something mean without making it obvious

i said it in my bio and im also gonno say it here c+h/int is heavily encouraged. tc

if u even care (not really important)

🌙/🟢 free to interact

⛔️ little to no response or just busy

💤 afk


DNI: weird ppl in general, proshippers, idc if its ur copping mechanism it makes me uncomfortable. HEAVY dni if ur whole personality is ur partner im not tolerating ur 5 paragraph bs on how much u miss ur partner/ex, super sensitive people is an exeption but you should interact w caution.

still a wip okay hai bai
