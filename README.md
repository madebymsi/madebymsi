ive noticed i have a social awareness of a potato and that i suck at carrying the convo im sorry if im boring to talk to, im actively trying my best to literally just stay in topic since i jump from one to another without realizing, im really socially awkward at first so mybad if i make the convo dry. OK I NOTICED LIKE ALOT OF TIMES WHEN THE CONVO GETS DRY OR AWKWARD I TEND TO LEAVE MAKING A STUPID EXCUSE IM SORRY I CANT HELP IT 💔
