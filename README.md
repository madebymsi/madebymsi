INTERACT WITH CAUTION, MY HUMOUR CAN MAKE SOME PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

 hi im solace/bread im a minor and my main interests are msi, cry of fear, forsaken, combat initiation, PLS COMBAT INITIATION AND CRY OF FEAR FANS WRY.. 💔

BYI
ive noticed i have a social awareness of a potato and that i suck at carrying the convo im sorry if im boring to talk to, im actively trying my best to literally just stay in topic since i jump from one to another without realizing, im really socially awkward at first so mybad if i make the convo dry. sometimes im too shy to approach you. plspls use he/him pronouns i lwk get upset when someone uses she/her but its ok, lol pink white purple black blue

i said it in my bio and im also gonno say it here c+h/int is heavily encouraged. tc

if u even care (not really important)

🌙/🟢 free to interact

⛔️ little to no response or just busy

💤 afk


DNI: weird ppl in general, proshippers, idc if its ur copping mechanism it makes me uncomfortable. HEAVY dni if ur whole personality is ur partner im not tolerating ur 5 paragraph bs on how much u miss ur partner/ex, super sensitive people is an exeption but you should interact w caution.
